## Ignasi
So let's talk about the technology powering our solution:

In order to provide a better service and promote adhesion to the treatment and suicide prevention, we collect some data from the patient. The subjective data is collected via a virtual assistan, as Ignasi has said.

So he objective data is collected via a weareble with 3 sensors.
We collect the hearth rythm, the electrodermal activity and the movement in order to see if there's any vibration.
Our product, then, integrates BigData, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in order to provide reliable information to help the doctor make the best decision.

### What's the data process?
The prototype we have built this weekend can be miniaturized into something like this, very easy to use in a daily basis. So we get the data from the wearable. And we preprocess it to extract the important signal. Then, we apply Machine Learning techniques to characterize the data and, finally, an AI system that assesses the doctor. As we move forward in this scheme, we are adding value to ou product, because it's not just data, but the information we can get from it. And the improvement it means.

Now Igansi will explain how we integrate this together.

Now it's time for the numbers. So Jordi:
